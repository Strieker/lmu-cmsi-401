Evaluation and Feedback
CMSI 401 project ~~ Fall 2020/Spring 2021
Sage Strieker
Error Handling in Swift project
   Final submission for Incomplete
===========================================
Evaluation of your final documentation ~ what can I say, Sage!?

You did a fantastic job.  This is a very difficult thing to put together
with something that you are entering "in the middle" so to speak.  One may
or may not have access to any artifacts from the project, and since your
portion was in constant flux, it is VERY difficult to put together this kind
of documentation in that situation.

Still, you did a great job with it.  Your writing is clear, your diagrams to
the point [and colorful! :) ] and your explanations allow the reader to see
exactly what you are doing and what the philosopy behind the project is.

I'm proceeding on the assumption that you will be putting some examples of
your source code for the project into your repo in the next day or two, but
based on the quality of the documentation you've submitted, you're earning
full credit for that portion as well.

Great work Sage ~ an amazing job under the most difficult of circumstances!

I just have two words for you:

      ROCK STAR!!!
