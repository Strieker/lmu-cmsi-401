CMSI 401 project ~~ Fall 2020
Sage Strieker
Error Handling in Swift project
=================================
Presentation:
   this is a very interesting project, and one of the rare capstones that
   considers compilers!  for that alone it is noteworthy, Sage!  further, the
   fact that you are working solo it admirable.  one thing you should think
   about during this semester, though, is to look ahead and see if you can do
   something about a group project for 402.  There will be a couple of groups
   that will extend through the second semester, and I just want to make sure
   you get the group/team experience as part of your LMU course work.  also,
   I can't view your presentation, since it's something called a "key" file ~
   I'm guessing that is a Mac application, so I'm going to try to view it in
   my office tomorrow on the Mac I have there.  from what I remember, though,
   you did a great job of presenting some intricate material in a way that
   all of the audience can understand.

Proposal Document:
   what can I say, Sage.... awesome work!  I'm really looking forward to this
   project and seeing what you are doing... heck, I may even have to learn to
   program in Swift!!  :D
